This file contains notes for implementing backend-integrated flows.

All customer flows need:
1. Call get-bearer-token-subflow
2. Make HTTP request to backend with Bearer token
3. Handle responses and errors

All card flows need same pattern.

Backend endpoints:
- Customers: /admin/customers
- Cards: /admin/cards
- Login: /admin/login

Token in Authorization: Bearer {token}
